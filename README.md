## Java Conditionals and Control Flow

## If-Then Statement

```
public class Order {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    double itemCost = 30.99;
    
    // Write an if-then statement:
  }
}
```

The code editor contains an `Order` class to track retail shipments.

Write an `if-then` statement that prints `High value item!` when `itemCost` is greater than `24.00`.
