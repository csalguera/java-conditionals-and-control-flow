## Java Conditionals and Control Flow

## If-Then Statement

```
public class Order {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    double itemCost = 30.99;
    
    // Write an if-then statement:
  }
}
```

1. The code editor contains an `Order` class to track retail shipments.

    Write an `if-then` statement that prints `High value item!` when `itemCost` is greater than `24.00`.

## If-Then-Else

```
public class Order {
  
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    
    boolean isFilled = false;
    
    // Write an if-then-else statement:
    
    
  }
  
}
```

1. In the code editor, there is an `isFilled` value, that represents whether the order is ready to ship.

    Write an if-then-else statement that:

* When `isFilled` is `true`, print `Shipping`.
* When `isFilled` is `false`, print `Order not ready`.
